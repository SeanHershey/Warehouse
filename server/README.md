# Warehouse Server
An API that allows its employees to get physical inventory.
Able to add new warehouses.
Then associate an itemâ€™s storage shelf with a physical location or zone.

API - https://warehouse-pcmv.onrender.com/graphql  
Contact - sean.p.hershey@gmail.com  

The backend is built on FastAPI.  
I used Strawberry for GraphQL classes, which made queries easy to represent.  
Then I ran Postgres SQL with SQLalchemy to the Supabase database (The schema can be found in schema.sql).  
CORS was handled using Starlette.
