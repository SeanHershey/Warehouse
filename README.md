## Stack

**Frontend**
- React
- TypeScript
- Apollo Client

Using Vite provided a minimal setup to get React + TypeScript working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.  
I then added ApolloClient to send GraphQL queries and mutations.  
I created React components for GetShelves, CreateWarehouse, CreateShelf, GetStatus, and Reset.  
I did simple CSS styling for the App as a whole.  

**Backend**
- GraphQL
- FastAPI
- Postgres

The backend is built on FastAPI.  
I used Strawberry for GraphQL classes, which made queries easy to represent.  
Then I ran Postgres SQL with SQLalchemy to the Supabase database (The schema can be found in schema.sql).  
CORS was handled using Starlette.  

**Deployment**
- Supabase
- Render

Supabase handles the database tables and a CRON job that keeps the sites up always accessible.  
Render hosts the API server and the website.
